# Generated Quotes Directory

This directory contains generated quote files (.docx and .pdf).

Files are automatically created when users generate quotes and are available for download.

## File Naming Convention:

- quote_{templateId}_{timestamp}.pdf

## Cleanup:
Consider implementing a cleanup job to remove old files periodically to save disk space.
